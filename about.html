            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a group of passionate students who are interested in the power of nature and its ability to heal. Our project, <span class="highlight">HerbList</span>, is created to educate and inform people about the incredible medicinal plants that nature provides. We believe in the importance of traditional herbal remedies and aim to make knowledge about these plants easily accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>As students, we are constantly learning and growing, and we wanted to share our newfound knowledge and love for plants with the world. Whether you're a beginner or someone experienced in herbalism, we hope this platform provides valuable insights and inspires you to explore the healing potential of plants.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you find the information helpful and inspiring!</p>
